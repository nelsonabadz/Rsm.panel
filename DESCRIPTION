Description: The objective of Rsm.panel is to offer a Shiny panel featuring 
    response surface methods. This is achieved by allowing users to specify 
    the dependent and independent variables of the uploaded dataset. 
    The function further provides various first- and second-order models, 
    both with and without interaction terms. Additionally, Rsm.panel furnishes
    insights into the optimal region of the surface and its corresponding location.
